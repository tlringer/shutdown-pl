# This Wednesday, June 10, it's time to #ShutdownPL

In the United States, the most recent murders of Black people at the hands of police have prompted international protest that has itself been met with further police brutality---the latest manifestation of a centuries-old history of violence and oppression. We in the global programming languages community acknowledge that every institution in our society is built on a foundation of white supremacy---and our academic systems and research industry are no exception. We have the strongest moral imperative to act not just in this particular moment of political turmoil and uncertainty, but in lasting, sustainable ways to permanently transform our institutions against the systemic racism from which they benefit and which they perpetuate.

# Join Us

On this **Wednesday, June 10, 10:00 am - 3:00 pm PST**, we join in the movement to [#ShutdownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) for a global [#Strike4BlackLives](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Strike4BlackLives). We call on anyone in the global programming languages community to come listen, work, and plan to actively reject racism from the systems we create and the systems within which we exist. We know that one day of action is not enough: our goal is to both achieve small immediate change, and to facilitate the planning of broader systemic change across the world of programming languages research.

We will be holding a virtual day of conversation and focused group action. We encourage you to attend for all or most of the day, but we will be happy to welcome you if you can only be there some of the time. Our schedule (subject to change at the desire of participants):

```
10:00 - 10:30 PST (18:00-18:30 UTC): Introduction, opening, setting intentions
10:45 - 12:00 PST (18:45-20:00 UTC): Break into smaller self-determined groups
12:30 -  1:00 PST (20:30-21:00 UTC): Progress check-in, discussion
1:15  -  2:30 PST (21:15-22:30 UTC): Second round of focused small group work
2:30  -  3:00 PST (22:30-23:00 UTC): Closing discussion
```

Both of the organizers of Shutdown PL are white, and we do not want to demand labor from black voices on a day that is focused on sustained allyship. However, the last thing we want is a day of nonblack researchers speaking for and taking actions on the behalf of black researchers without first listening. Accordingly, we will ensure all actions we commit to include plans to reach out and listen and make sure those actions are reasonable, or otherwise adjust our plans.

Looking forward to seeing you there,
